# July 20th: Research
I researched about building mechanical keyboard, made the inital list of features that I am planning to include, explored websites related to mechanical keyboards (ranging from online stores, to various subreddits and youtube videos). Also, looked at some already approved mech keyboards projects submitted for highhway for more info + inspiration.

**(Initial) List of Features:**
- wireless connectivity (and therefore bluetooth + battery) [decided upon nice!nano v2 and li-ion 1100maH battery for now]
- layout = TKL/75% (depending upon if i wish to include a i2c expander or not in pcb) => 87/88 keys OR 81/84/85 keys
- dropping the rotary encoder for now
- sound = thoc (some kind of linear/tactile switches --> prob mx red/brown/black, might look at gateron for cheaper options) (will put some packing foam underneath as mod, not planning to include proper foam for mech keeb yet)
- keycaps --> white-to-blue gradient side printed keycaps (the printed label should be translucent so that rgb light can shine through)
- 3D printed case --> might inclide a nice tilt for better ergo --> white coloured
- per-key rgb via sk2852mini-e leds

**Total time spent: 3hr**

# July 21st - July 22nd: Schematic for PCB
Made the schematic for the keyboard's pcb. this took a lot of googling, asking in #highway in hackclub's slack, and also some perplexity-done research (because why not) (cross-checked everyhting though).
Made the following updates to the overall project plans as well:
- decided to go ahead with the 75% layout - 81 keys
- added the rotary encoder (since i had to use an i2c expander anyway becuase of the neopixels)

Found a design (mostly just the layout( inspiration:
