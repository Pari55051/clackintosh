# Clackintosh
a wireless mechanical keyboard, with 75% layout (81 keys) and a rotary encoder. 
this accompanies my other hardware projects, namely, Clackinntosh Jr. (a macropad), Clackade (a small, very basic PCB-based game console), and Clickster (mouse based on Bambu Lab's Mouse Kit)

## Features
- 75% layout (81 keys) + a rotary encoder
- based on nice!nano v2 MCU
- has underglow LEDs to light up the side-printed keycaps
- hotswappable switches (Cherry MX Red/Brown)
- wireless with 10000mah battery
- ~ 4Â° tilt for ergonomics
- ZMK firmware
- a blank white case so that i can create a custom grafitti wall, but stickers and keeb case, on it

> this would have hotswappable switches, i did not add t to the pcb since i had to manually add for each key, the footprint is chosen appropriately)

### Case
> the case has space on top to add custom stickers (hackclub merch ones, since i don't know where to put them)

### Full Assembly
> the fully assembled one's PCB is not placed properly (not rotated to the correct angle) since there was some unknwon error in onshape where i could not rotate the thing, whenever i tried to rotate it would load and then no changes would occur. i tried my best to rotate it, and debug this but could not do so.
> will update the images if i'm able to do so in the future

## Challenges
the biggest challenge i faced was getting the schematcs right. i got the thing reviewed multiple times (on reddit, on #highway), added components, removed components, re-added components (capacitors, i'm looking at you)
another challenge was the case CAD, which had unexpected errors.
